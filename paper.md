# Summary

In the neuroimaging domain, most imaging equipment comes with its own binary
format to store raw imaging data. It has always been a challenge for researchers
to handle these formats and convert them into formats compatible with the processing
tools used in their research. For example at this time the popular 
EEGLAB toolbox for MATLAB supports over 30 different data formats.

Bittium NeurOne is a research-grade EEG system that comes with a recording 
software which, like many others, has its own proprietary binary format for storing
raw recordings. For a long time, MATLAB has been a popular processing environment
in neuroscientific research, but lately especially with the rise of machine
learning methods python has also become more present in neuroscientific workflows.
Despite this, Bittium at this time only provides a MATLAB conversion script for their
data format, so python-based workflows had to include a conversion step using
the proprietary MATLAB software.

To enable pure python processing of data recorded with Bittium NeurOne we created
the ``neurone_loader`` python package. It provides the ability to load data in the
proprietary NeurOne binary format in pure python. The data can be used directly
as ``numpy`` arrays or imported into ``python-mne`` [@Gramfort2013] [@Gramfort2014],
a popular python package for processing neuroimaging data.

Since EEG data is often recorded at very high sampling rates and single recordings
can reach sizes of hundreds of gigabytes ``neurone_laoder`` was designed with 
memory restrictions in mind. To make it easier to work with data this large even
in environments with (relatively) restricted memory resources, most data will be
loaded lazily and redundant data will be removed from memory as soon as it has been
copied.
